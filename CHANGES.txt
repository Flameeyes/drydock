DRYDOCK, CHANGES

#### TODO ###############################

* Support putting descriptions into resource file (or __END__)
* Inline commands aliases. command :cmd1, :cmd2 do; ...; end


#### 0.5.3 (2009-04-05) #############################

* FIXED: Command actions were not being handled correctly. Added rdocs to 
clarify the code.


#### 0.5.2 (2009-04-04) #############################

* ADDED: before and after blocks now receive a primed reference to the 
command object (which gives them access to the globals and options)
* CHANGE: The prep stuff in Drydock::Command#call is now split into a
separate method: prepare so call no longer takes arguments. 
* FIXED: Drydock#capture_io was using yield. It now accepts a block instead. 


#### 0.5.1 (2009-03-15) #############################

* FIXED: Prevent calling default command in at_exit when there's a LoadError.
* FIXED: Exit gracefully when the application exits. 
* FIXED: Print command names with dashes rather than underscores


#### 0.5 (2009-03-11) ###############################

* ADDED: Checks that the command class is a subclass of Drydock::Command
* CHANGE: Cleaned up show-commands screen
* FIXED: Help didn't work when using command alias
* ADDED: Named argv values.
* CHANGE: argv are now part of the Command class (not passed to command blocks)
* CHANGE: "project" now automatically requires the lowercase name of the project
and gracefully continues if the require failed. 
* CHANGE: Drydock will look for different validation method, based on the method 
being executed. If a validation method is found it's executed and
must return a true valid (it can also raise its own exceptions).
* ADDED: command actions. These are boolean switches with a twist. Drydock looks
for command_action or action_command methods. Saves checking the switches
and sending to other methods manually.


#### 0.4 (2009-02-28) ###############################

* FIXED: "interning empty string" error when bare "option" is used
* ADDED: Calls valid? method (if present) before calling command block.
* ADDED: "capture" method. Auto capture STDOUT to obj.stdout etc...
* ADDED: Automatically calls init and print_header methods before the command
       and print_footer after the command (if available)
* ADDED: Tries to call obj.command if available when no block is supplied
* ADDED: "show_commands" command built-in. Displays commands with descriptions
* ADDED: A default usage help msg for every command: "#{$0} command-name"
* ADDED: "usage" work multiple times for the same command. 
* ADDED: "desc" method for per command descriptions
* CHANGE: options are now stored as obj.option.name instead of obj.name
* CHANGE: global options are now stored as obj.globals.name
* CHANGE: removed auto importing methods
    OLD: require 'drydock'
