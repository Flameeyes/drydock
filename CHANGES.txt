DRYDOCK, CHANGES

#### 0.5 (2009-03-01) ###############################

* CHANGE: argv are now part of the Command class (not passed to command blocks)
* CHANGE: "project" now automatically requires the lowercase name of the project
          and gracefully continues if the require failed. 
* CHANGE: Drydock will look for different validation method, based on the method 
          being executed. If a validation method is found it's executed and
          must return a true valid (it can also raise its own exceptions).
* NEW: command actions. These are boolean switches with a twist. Drydock looks
       for command_action or action_command methods. Saves checking the switches
       and sending to other methods manually.

* FIX: Bug, "interning empty string" error when bare "option" is used
* NEW: Calls valid? method (if present) before calling command block.

       and print_footer after the command (if available)
