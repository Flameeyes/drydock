DRYDOCK, CHANGES

#### TODO ###############################

* Support putting descriptions into resource file (or __END__)
* Define aliases with "command [:name, :alias]"
* Add Drydock::Console, Drydock::Window, Drydock::Cursor
* Generate scripts in the form: script-action
  * globals can be configured with env vars.
  * Motivation to stick to a single environment (just stage)
* Add convenience methods for system calls: sh, write, read 

#### 0.5.1 (2009-03-15) #############################

* FIX: Prevent calling default command in at_exit when there's a LoadError.
* FIX: Exit gracefully when the application exits. 
* FIX: Print command names with dashes rather than underscores


#### 0.5 (2009-03-11) ###############################

* NEW: Checks that the command class is a subclass of Drydock::Command
* CHANGE: Cleaned up show-commands screen
* FIXED: Help didn't work when using command alias
* NEW: Named argv values.
* CHANGE: argv are now part of the Command class (not passed to command blocks)
* CHANGE: "project" now automatically requires the lowercase name of the project
and gracefully continues if the require failed. 
* CHANGE: Drydock will look for different validation method, based on the method 
being executed. If a validation method is found it's executed and
must return a true valid (it can also raise its own exceptions).
* NEW: command actions. These are boolean switches with a twist. Drydock looks
for command_action or action_command methods. Saves checking the switches
and sending to other methods manually.


#### 0.4 (2009-02-28) ###############################

* FIXED: "interning empty string" error when bare "option" is used
* NEW: Calls valid? method (if present) before calling command block.
* NEW: "capture" method. Auto capture STDOUT to obj.stdout etc...
* NEW: Automatically calls init and print_header methods before the command
       and print_footer after the command (if available)
* NEW: Tries to call obj.command if available when no block is supplied
* NEW: "show_commands" command built-in. Displays commands with descriptions
* NEW: A default usage help msg for every command: "#{$0} command-name"
* NEW: "usage" work multiple times for the same command. 
* NEW: "desc" method for per command descriptions
* CHANGE: options are now stored as obj.option.name instead of obj.name
* CHANGE: global options are now stored as obj.globals.name
* CHANGE: removed auto importing methods
    OLD: require 'drydock'
    NEW: require 'drydock'
         extend Drydock
